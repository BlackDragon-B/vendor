# Adven-CC Vendor Software
This repository contains the Adven vendor software.

## Installation Instructions
For V2, four elements are required on a computer network. These elements include an Ender Chest, Speaker, Turtle, and a Monitor. To set up the main program, download `updater.lua` as `startup.lua` and `config.lua`. Set `turtleNetworkID` to your turtle's number ID on the network. That's pretty much it!

## Ender Chest
The ender chest is on a private channel to prevent abuse. If you would like one, please contact znepb.
